  <h1>Patagonia Salmon Run</h1>
  <p>Every year, Patagonia puts on a benefit 5k race to raise money for local environmental groups. I created this artwork as the logo and t-shirt design for the 2016 Patagonia Salmon Run, which benefited Once Upon a Watershed, a local organization working to restore Ventura county’s wetlands and watersheds. The artwork I created is a hand-carved linoleum blockprint.</p>

    <p>The artwork I created was used on race t-shirts, Patagonia’s website, and other promotional materials.</p>
