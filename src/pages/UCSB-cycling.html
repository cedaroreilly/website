  <h1>UCSB Cycling</h1>
  <p>I was commisioned by the UCSB Cycling Team to design a new team logo and t-shirt design. The team wanted a professional look for their logo so I created a clean design that incorporated an element of cycling with the bicycle chain in the school colorsâ€”yellow and blue.</p>
